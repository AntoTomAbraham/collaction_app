Last year 14,487 people across the globe joined. This year we want to grow our community to 25.000 people that collectively make conscious fashion choices. Slow Fashion Season aims to raise awareness about the fashion industry and how you as a consumer play a role in it, while providing you with a concrete action that has real impact and brings you into a community.",

Below you can read more about the Big Food Switch! Ever thought about what you eat? No worries if you didn’t, but now might be the time. Because food is one of the strongest ways to improve our health and environment. How food is produced and what we eat has a huge impact on us and our planet.',

I walked with my grandmother through the gardens of our village on Sicily, while staring at some grapes that were almost ripe to pick. It was a warm summer day and I heard: ”Forza Fabio, siamo pronti per mangiare”. Lunch was ready. It felt warm on my skin. Definitely during the summer holidays. My family sat ready for our lunch, a well-deserved traditional three course meal was waiting for us. The entire family was there ofcourse. When I look back at it, the setting must have looked like one of these traditional Bertolli commercials. The gardens of my family was a place where I spent a lot of my time growing up. Every summer was beautiful, spending this amount of time at the vegetable gardens, where the chickens were running around, and the pears and olives were almost ready to eat. It was a beautiful place, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
