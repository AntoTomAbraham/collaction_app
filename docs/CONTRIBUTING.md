# <a name="filing-an-issue"></a> Filing an issue or a bug
We are super stoked if you are ready to file your first issue/bug report! If that is the case, please use the issue template or [click here to file a bug report](https://github.com/CollActionteam/collaction_app/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D%3A+Your+issue+title+here).

Before filing an issue, try searching in the issues for keywords related to the issue you are experiencing, there is a chance that someone else already filed the same issue!

It's important when you file an issue, that you try to complete the template as much as possible, this helps with narrowing down the issue, discussing possible solutions, and in the end solving the issue and continuing to build great features!

But fret not, if you somehow have a hard time finding the information requested in the template, we will do our best to help you after you have created the issue. Keep in mind, the most important thing when filing an issue, **is the steps on how to reproduce the bug!**

# <a name="feature-request"></a> Filing a feature request
A feature request is all you need when you have a spark of inspiration. When filing a feature request you do it in the [issues section](https://github.com/CollActionteam/collaction_app/issues), remember to select the feature request template, or [click here to start filing a feature request](https://github.com/CollActionteam/collaction_app/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BSUGGESTION%5D%3A+Your+suggestion+title+here).

Describe your idea in as much detail you can, no need to be super technical, but the better your idea is described, the easier its intent is to understand. Sadly it's not easy to guarantee that all features are as relevant, or all features will be implemented, we have to filter them to select the features with the most value. Don't be discouraged if your first feature request is denied, feel free to try another feature.

Before filing a feature request, try searching in the issues for keywords related to the feature request you have in mind, there is a chance that someone else already filed the same or a similar request!
